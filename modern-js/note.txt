primitive and reference data type

falsy values: false, 0, blank(""), null, undefined, NaN
truthy values: which values are not falsy they are truthy

method change main array(push, splice, shift)

method return:

find() first matching item (if not found return undefined)
findIndex() first matching index (if not found return -1)
filter() all matching item as array (if not found return [])
slice() small portion of an array 
splice() small portion of an array (if not found all deleteCount then remove how many found)
concat() an array
map() an array
reduce() 0 is initialValue. previousValue store current return

method parameter:
find() currentValue, currentIndex, array
slice() startIndex, endingIndex
splice() startIndex, deleteCount, items
reduce() previousValue, currentValue, currentIndex and array

in for in loop we get index number
in for of loop we get item

by Object.keys(objectName) we get all keys as a array
by Object.values(objectName) we get all values as array
by Object.entries(objectName) we get all key + value. each entry is a array inside a array

spread operator make a carbon copy if we change main array copy array doesn't change. used in array and object
rest operator used in function. it is better than arguments

for import and export anything we need package.json file
in default import we can import only one thing

``(backtick key) template literals.
tagged template . Using it, we can go between the strings and values ​​in the template literals and run different operations if we want.

we make array in 2 ways
let myArray1 = []; // literal syntax
let myArray2 = new Array(); // constructor syntax

set and weakset

array object set weakset are data structure in js. set reference data type like array and object. sets are not array, set and array both are different. set used for store unique data. any data can be added into set. we can make set only using constructor syntax. set is a list of unique value.

we can do method chaining with set method because it return modified set.

method:
add() add element
delete() delete element
clear() delete all element
has() check element exist in set or not
size check set length

we can pass any iterable in set and set it also iterable. set has no order. using spread operator we can convert set into an array.

we only add object in weakset it takes iterable but it is not iterable like set

copyWithin js array method

3 parameter target start end

The elements that are found between the start and end position will be copied and placed in the place of the target position.Whoever is in the target position will pick it up. 

target required.
start end optional.
start default 0. 
end default arraylength.
never change array length.
overwrite main array. 
return modified array.
