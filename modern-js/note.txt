falsy values: false, 0, blank(""), null, undefined, NaN
truthy values: which values are not falsy they are truthy

method change main array(push, splice)

method return:

find() first matching item (if not found return undefined)
findIndex() first matching index (if not found return -1)
filter() all matching item as array (if not found return [])
slice() small portion of an array 
splice() small portion of an array (if not found all deleteCount then remove how many found)
concat() an array
map() an array
reduce() 0 is initialValue. previousValue store current return

method parameter:
find() currentValue, currentIndex, array
slice() startIndex, endingIndex
splice() startIndex, deleteCount, items
reduce() previousValue, currentValue, currentIndex and array

in for in loop we get index number
in for of loop we get item

by Object.keys(objectName) we get all keys as a array
by Object.values(objectName) we get all values as array
by Object.entries(objectName) we get all key + value. each entry is a array inside a array

spread operator make a carbon copy if we change main array copy array doesn't change. used in array and object
rest operator used in function. it is better than arguments
